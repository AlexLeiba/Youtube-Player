i'm not really dressed for it i don't

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.840
even have a hat

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:14.400
should have brought an umbrella

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:15.840
hopefully the sky clears up let's see

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
you can tell the people the provinces

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.840
they wear thick shoes thick black shoes

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.000
to protect them from the snow and the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.919
mud in the villages i used to have a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.360
romantic image of what a russian village

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.520
was like

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.120
of moving there buying a little house

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.800
there and setting up a life maybe in a

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.160
village just reading books reading check

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.240
off for the rest of my life

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.440
and then i went once in the winter and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.639
saw the muddy

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.400
slushy here's my bus the muddy slushy

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.759
nastiness of a russian village in the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.759
winter in the spring

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.520
and i was like you know what maybe i

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.520
won't move to a village in russia

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.520
look at the weather look at that

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:00.080
snow sleet nasty as hell

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.080
oh man

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:11.840
this has the potential to be a very

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.840
nasty day

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.759
right it's not that one

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.639
it's confusing reading these tickets

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.400
when i walk around here with my camera

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.520
talking and people walk past me i hear

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.720
them saying to each other

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.280
oh correspondent correspondent

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.199
correspondent it makes me sound like i'm

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.600
some kind of professional journalist

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.560
i like it it's better than them saying

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.919
some

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.560
dude with some youtube channel i like

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.880
being a correspondent gives me an air of

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.400
authority

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:03.199
maybe they think i work for the times

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.199
daily mail hopefully correspondent

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.880
correspondent

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.600
hey my bus has arrived to karamah this

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.880
little green number check it out

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.880
check out the deluxeness all right

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.840
jump on

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.160
i'm on the bus this is pretty quiet

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.919
there's only two other people here

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.360
so corma definitely isn't a tourist

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.759
destination not many people going down

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.680
there

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.600
or at least not this time in the morning

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.120
so uh we'll see what it's like

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.639
hopefully the snow has stopped by the

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.840
time we get there

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.840
let's see

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.400
in this region of the country what we're

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.680
seeing along the way is

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.840
forest farmland small villages

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.039
and cemeteries cemeteries full of

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.039
hundreds of blue crosses

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.919
this region of belarus has had a tragic

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.919
history

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:31.840
and i'm seeing evidence of that now

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:45.199
we've stopped off in a town called

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.039
dobrush which is about two kilometers on

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:50.400
the russian border

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:58.319
you've gotta hear the old bus station

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:59.840
built in pre-revolutionary times

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.759
this part of the region this part of the

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.960
country has been shifting

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:06.560
borders have been shifting once this

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.759
town of dorbrush was in

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.639
poland and then it was in russia once it

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.560
was under the

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.840
domination of sweden when sweden

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.680
controlled this area

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.360
before the battle of poltava where the

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.800
russians defeated the swedes once in

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.759
parole

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.000
then the soviets came and then finally

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.680
in 1991 belarus

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.680
for the first time in its life in its

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.879
history obtained true independence and

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.879
became an independent country

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.719
dog rush in the winter

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.839
it's a little bit grim

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.839
[Music]

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.279
exciting right

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.040
a little rural community in belarus

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:59.040
that has been many foreigners come down

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.399

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.399
building

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:05.760
this old soviet style building you've

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:08.000
still got the hammer and sickle on the

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.000
top

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:11.440
let's see who this dude is

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.040
he's got a statue it is

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:30.880
i have no idea some bill a russian dude

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.800
he's got here a little flag

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.320
which means he was probably a member of

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.760
the communist party

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.200
let's have a look up here up here on the

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.320
building here we've still got the old

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.760
hammer and sickle

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.519
you see in belarus this stuff hasn't

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.920
been removed unlike in the ukraine where

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.839
it's all been ripped down and torn down

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.000
in belarus you still see the old hammer

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:51.279
and sickle

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.120

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.360
some more exploring here in karamah

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:01.680
the worst time to travel in belarus and

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.360
this region

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.560
isn't the winter as you might expect

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.920
when it's really cold but it's the

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.320
spring right now

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.920
because the snow melts and turns

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.760
everything to a muddy slush

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.360
and if you're not prepared like i'm not

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.360
in my converse

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.279
then um you're gonna suffer the best

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.640
time to travel is the summer or

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:29.839
the winter when it's snowy underfoot

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.839
not now

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.000
in the provinces of belarus everything

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.880
is painted

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.360
blue dark blue light blue i call it

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.120
bella russian blue because everything

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.640
is painted in this color for some reason

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.640
i never quite know but every time you go

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.600
to a graveyard or something or you see a

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.279
church

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.680
or anything pretty much in the region

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:53.760
it's painted this color blue

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.279
like up here everything is blue the

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.639
benches are blue

00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:00.320
the bins are blue everything's blue the

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:03.279
church is blue

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.279
can we go inside

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.839
always open

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.320
the russian people are deeply religious

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.680
the church plays a huge part in the life

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.839
of people especially the elderly

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.120
i suppose when you've been let down so

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:45.920
much by governments and

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.440
by the harshness of life that you put

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.519
your hope in something else you put your

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.600
faith in god

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.720
maybe it's some kind of way to ensure

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.800
that the next life

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.800
isn't as harsh as this life

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.320
all right let's carry on let's follow

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:03.680
the road old lads are here they still

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.079
drive them down here in the provinces

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.760
the oldie

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:10.399
in the west we call them larders but in

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.399
russia you call them

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:15.839
oh there's a pavement let's follow the

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.839
pavement

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:21.760
you can see here the horse manure or cow

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:23.839
manure

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.760
this is a rural farming community so

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:27.760
animals and stuff will all be passing

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.959
through here

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:34.000
this region of belarus is very rural

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:35.760
the only employer really is

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.920
either small little shops and post

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.240
office and government offices

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.600
or the farm it's where people make their

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.360
money

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:49.839
here comes a big pile of steaming [ __ ]

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.839
these are

00:13:55.199 --> 00:13:59.519
in fact all you can smell in the air is

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:02.880
cow [ __ ]

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:05.600
the smell of the village

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.839
here's the local lake kids probably

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.760
swimming this in the summertime

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:13.040
do their fishing the biggest pastime in

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:18.079
belarus and russia

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:20.720
is fishing no one fishes like a russian

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:22.000
they love to just go out and sit on the

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.680
riverside

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.519
put their line in the water or in the

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.959
winter sit on the ice make a hole in the

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:30.000
ice

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:33.360
drop a line in try and catch some fish

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.240
here we have an old bella russian house

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.120
this is a traditional izba a wooden

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.120
house in the village

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:43.360
and up here i want to show you something

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:46.639
well without falling in the snow

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.639
up here is a red star

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:54.639
when you see a red star on a house it

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:59.680
means that someone

00:14:54.639 --> 00:15:01.279
lived here who fought in the war

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.360
everyone fought in the war if you're old

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:05.360
enough look at it now

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:12.000
wow the smell of [ __ ] is in the air

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.199
[ __ ] is in the air every time i look

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.440
around

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:18.880
and i don't know if i can do it

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.839
here's some kind of abandoned old

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.199
building all boarded up and

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:26.240
done up some pre-revolutionary building

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:27.680
pre-revolutionary building hard to speak

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.079
when it's so cold your mouth stops

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.079
working

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:34.800
i don't know what this building was

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:36.160
before maybe it belonged to some rich

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.040
landowner

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.120
some kulak who was liquidated and

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.880
executed under the communists or sent

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.720
north to the camps

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.320
as unfortunately many people who owned a

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.399
horse or owned their own cow

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.079
were i wonder if we can have a little

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.040
look in

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:53.040
probably where the local

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.120
dope smokers come to hang out but

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:58.480
there's bottles of beer in here

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.279
can we get in here somehow let's have a

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.279
little expiration

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.240
we can see up here the old roof tiling

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:08.160
that they decorated it

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.440
under in the soviet union it's all

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.440
collapsing now this ceiling

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:21.839
and up there more this oral building was

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:25.040
done up what's through here

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:26.560
man i can't see a thing

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.320
right there let's get the old telephone

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.040
out

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.040
shine a light

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.839
can you get in here

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:52.880
anyone in here

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:54.959
there's the old fireplace which is now

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.360
all cemented up

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:59.600
so as i say this is a pre-revolutionary

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.600
building

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.680
that was oh what's in this a bag of

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.120
stuff a bag of clothes

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.079
what sort of clothes they got in here

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.720
maybe something i can wear some bloody

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:13.039
oh look at this maybe i could wear that

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.079
no it's a children's jumper

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:15.839
i don't want to be walking around the

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:19.839
villages of belarus in a children's

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.839
jumper i'll get a reputation

00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:26.480
i think i'm gonna have to stick my hand

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.600
out and ask for a lift

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:36.000
maybe this jaguar give me a lift maybe

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.000
maybe maybe no

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.080
whoa this dude's out of control

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.720
[Music]

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.960
you came around that corner like a wild

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.960
thing

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.080
he gave zero

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.520
uh uh this is the state farm

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.520
which is called a kolkaz which is on the

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.440
soviet times what happened after the

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.240
soviet union took control of the region

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.120
after the russian revolution they got

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.400
all the farms

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.480
that obviously belonged to the local

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.600
people before and amalgamated them

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.320
into big communal farms

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.679
and so here they are so this one here is

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.200
called

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:24.080
cool lifker called leifker

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.919
let's have a look at it and so mostly

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.720
it's cattle farming

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:30.559
chicken farming is there such a thing as

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.840
chicken farming

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:36.320
chickens keeping chickens

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.799
called glovka this is a cattle farm

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:42.720
there's a picture up there of a bull

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:45.039
and i can smell [ __ ]

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.039
well

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:51.760
we're coming to the end of karma here's

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.000
the road sign saying that the town's

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.000
over

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:59.440
are we going to carry on i reckon we

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.559
can't call it quits there i mean what's

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.520
that

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:11.600
we've got a little bit of an adventure

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:15.679
we haven't met anyone yet

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.679
wow let's get a thumbnail

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.039
often when i watch my videos back i'm

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.440
like why did i not get a good picture

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:23.120
for a thumbnail this might be a good one

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.600
just me looking out across the bleak

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.880
landscape moodily

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.880
pensively with a thought

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.360
the sign in the background

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:41.120
a good one might use that

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.120
right then so what now

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.480
let's carry on just walking down the

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:46.080
road and see what we find there's got to

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.000
be something in the distance

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.200
some village or something hopefully

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.440
i haven't eaten any breakfast so i've

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.720
got to find like a cafe or something

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.559
i might have to knock on some old

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.919
babbushka's door

00:19:56.559 --> 00:20:04.320
and say please can i have some bread

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:07.520
and butter or something some gritska

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.640
can i have a pink sausage any chance of

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.760
a pink sausage

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.760
someone stopped picking me up

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:21.840
oh my god what legend

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.320
legends pick me up

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:07.760
and drop me off at the turn off to the

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.760
next village which is called

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.159
all right let's check it out five

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.760
kilometers i've got a walk now

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:17.840
and there's some other legends pick me

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.840
up five kilometers to hiroshima

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.080
those guys who just gave me a lift

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:27.600
dropped me off it was funny because

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.520
every other word that they were using

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.280
was a russian swear word in russian they

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.919
call it mutt

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.919
swear words

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.320
and i realize that i'm not manly enough

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.799
russians the russians are more brutal

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:49.679
with their language i'm too polite

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:51.360
my ex-wife who is bella russian

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:53.200
she was always using the word bleen that

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.080
was the worst swear word she would use

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.320
with blin

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.120
oh blin or maybe if she is really angry

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.320
she'd say

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.080
short or short

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.240
and so i've picked that up and i also

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.240
say

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.919
that's not manly enough i need to be

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:12.400
more brutal to fit in here

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:14.640
i need to start upping the tempo and

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.640
saying

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:25.280
magazine coming up is the world's most

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.720
overloaded tractor

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.400
i get hit by it if this thing makes it

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.280
to the next village without tipping off

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.919
i'll be amazed

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.919
check it out those hay bales on top

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.840
wow

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.159
hey i see something in the distance the

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.679
roof of a house

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.880
you won't be able to see it from here

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:10.720
but i can just see in the distance

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.799
really in the distance

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.400
the little roof poking up over the
